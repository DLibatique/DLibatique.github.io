## Passages

  *The translations of items 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 are mine; all other translations are from Adams’ Loeb unless otherwise noted.*

<hr>

1\. οὐδὲ γὰρ ὁ νόμος **τοὺς ἰδιωτεύοντας**, ἀλλὰ **τοὺς πολιτευομένους** ἐξετάζει. (195)

For the law does not scrutinize **private citizens** but rather **those engaged in politics**.

<hr>

2\. τρίτον τίσι διαλέγεται; «Ἢ **πεπορνευμένος**,» φησίν, «ἢ **ἡταιρηκώς**·» τὸν γὰρ τὸ σῶμα τὸ ἑαυτοῦ **ἐφ᾿ ὕβρει πεπρακότα**, καὶ τὰ κοινὰ τῆς πόλεως ῥᾳδίως ἡγήσατο ἀποδώσεσθαι. (29-30)

Who is mentioned third? He says, “The man who has **prostituted** himself or **served as an escort**.” For Solon thought that he who **has sold** his own body **in** ***hybris*** would easily sell the common affairs of the city too.

<hr>

3\. ...εὔσαρκον ὄντα καὶ νέον καὶ **βδελυρὸν** καὶ ἐπιτήδειον πρὸς τὸ πρᾶγμα ὃ προῃρεῖτο ἐκεῖνος μὲν πράττειν, οὗτος δὲ **πάσχειν**. (41)

...[Timarchus] was handsome and young and **disgusting** and suitable for the deed which Misgolas wanted to perform and which Timarchus wanted **to endure**.

<hr>

4\. «ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, κλέπτουσιν ὑμῶν ἀνὴρ καὶ γυνὴ χιλίας δραχμάς.» Θαυμασάντων δ' ὑμῶν πῶς ἀνὴρ καὶ γυνὴ καὶ τίς ὁ λόγος, εἶπε μικρὸν διαλιπών· «ἀγνοεῖτε», ἔφη, «ὅ τι λέγω; ὁ μὲν ἀνήρ ἐστιν Ἡγήσανδρος ἐκεῖνος νυνί», ἔφη, «πρότερον δ' ἦν καὶ αὐτὸς Λεωδάμαντος γυνή· ἡ δὲ γυνὴ Τίμαρχος οὑτοσί.» (110-111)

“Fellow citizens, a man and a woman are conspiring to steal one thousand drachmas of yours.” Then you in astonishment cried, “How ‘a man and a woman,’ what are you talking about?” After a little he went on: “Don't you understand,” said he, “what I mean? The man is our friend Hegesandrus there, a man now, though he too used to be a woman, Laodamas's woman; as for the woman, she is Timarchus yonder.

<hr>

5\. Ἔπειθ' οἱ μὲν πατέρες ὑμῶν οὕτω περὶ τῶν **αἰσχρῶν** καὶ **καλῶν** διεγίγνωσκον, ὑμεῖς δὲ Τίμαρχον τὸν τοῖς αἰσχίστοις ἐπιτηδεύμασιν ἔνοχον ἀφήσετε; **τὸν ἄνδρα μὲν καὶ ἄρρενα τὸ σῶμα, γυναικεῖα δὲ ἁμαρτήματα ἡμαρτηκότα**; τίς οὖν ὑμῶν γυναῖκα λαβὼν ἀδικοῦσαν τιμωρήσεται; ἢ τίς οὐκ ἀπαίδευτος εἶναι δόξει τῇ μὲν κατὰ φύσιν ἁμαρτανούσῃ χαλεπαίνων, **τῷ δὲ παρὰ φύσιν ἑαυτὸν ὑβρίσαντι συμβούλῳ χρώμενος**; (185)

Such, then, was the judgment of your fathers concerning **things shameful** and **things honorable**; and shall their sons let Timarchus go free, a man chargeable with the most shameful practices, **a creature with the body of a man defiled with the sins of a woman**? In that case, who of you will punish a woman if he finds her in wrong doing? Or what man will not be regarded as lacking intelligence who is angry with her who errs by an impulse of nature, **while he treats as adviser the man who in despite of nature has sinned against his own body**?

<hr>

6\. ἕν τι τῶν αἰσχίστων ἡγησάμην εἶναι μὴ βοηθῆσαι τῇ τε πόλει πᾶσῃ και τοῖς νόμοις καὶ ὑμῖν καὶ ἐμαυτῷ … αἱ γὰρ **ἴδιαι ἔχθραι** πολλὰ πάνυ **τῶν κοινῶν** ἐπανορθοῦσι. (2)

I decided it would be one of the most shameful acts not to give aid to the entire city and our laws and you all and myself … **Private hostilities** very often set right **public affairs**.

<hr>

7\. Σκέψασθε δή, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, ὅσον διαφέρει ὁ Σόλων Τιμάρχου καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι, ὧν ἐγὼ ὀλίγῳ πρότερον ἐμνήσθην. Ἐκεῖνοι μέν γε **ᾐσχύνοντο** ἔξω τὴν χεῖρα ἔχοντες λέγειν, οὑτοσὶ δὲ οὐ πάλαι, ἀλλὰ πρώην ποτὲ **ῥίψας θοἰμάτιον γυμνὸς ἐπαγκρατίαζεν ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ**, οὕτω κακῶς καὶ **αἰσχρῶς** διακείμενος τὸ σῶμα ὑπὸ μέθης καὶ **βδελυρίας** ὥστε τούς γε εὖ φρονοῦντας ἐγκαλύψασθαι, **αἰσχυνθέντας** ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως, εἰ τοιούτοις συμβούλοις χρώμεθα. (26)

See now, fellow citizens, how unlike to Timarchus were Solon and those men of old whom I mentioned a moment ago. **They were too modest** to speak with the arm outside the cloak, but this man not long ago, yes, only the other day, **in an assembly of the people threw off his cloak and leaped about like a gymnast, half naked**, his body so reduced and **befouled** through drunkenness and **lewdness** that right-minded men, at least, covered their eyes, **being ashamed** for the city, that we should let such men as he be our advisers.

<hr>

8\. ἀμφοτέρῃσι δὲ χερσὶν ἑλὼν κόνιν αἰθαλόεσσαν  
χεύατο κὰκ κεφαλῆς, χαρίεν δ' **ᾔσχυνε** πρόσωπον. (Homer *Iliad* 18.23-24)

He took smoky dust in both his hands and poured it down on his head, and he **disfigured** his gracious face.

<hr>

9\. Ταῦτα μὲν οὖν πάλαι νενομοθέτηται· ὑμεῖς δ᾿ ἔτι προσέθεσθε καινὸν νόμον μετὰ τὸ καλὸν παγκράτιον, ὃ οὗτος ἐπαγκρατίασεν ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, **ὑπεραισχυνθέντες** ἐπὶ τῷ πράγματι. (33)

Now these regulations of the law have long been in force; but you went further and added a new law, after that charming gymnastic exhibition which Timarchus gave in an assembly of the people; for **you were exceedingly ashamed** of the affair.

<hr>

10\. Δέομαι δ' ὑμῶν, ὦ Ἀθηναῖοι, συγγνώμην μοι ἔχειν ἐὰν ἀναγκαζόμενος λέγειν περὶ ἐπιτηδευμάτων φύσει μὲν **μὴ καλῶν**, τούτῳ δὲ πεπραγμένων, ἐξαχθῶ τι ῥῆμα εἰπεῖν ὅ ἐστιν ὅμοιον τοῖς ἔργοις τοῖς Τιμάρχου. Οὐδὲ γὰρ ἂν δικαίως ἐμοὶ ἐπιτιμήσαιτε, εἴ τι σαφῶς εἴποιμι διδάσκειν βουλόμενος, ἀλλὰ πολὺ μᾶλλον τουτῳί. Οὕτω γὰρ **αἰσχρῶς τυγχάνει βεβιωκὼς** ὥστε τὸν τὰ τούτῳ πεπραγμένα διεξιόντα ἀδύνατον εἶναι εἰπεῖν ὡς αὐτὸς βούλεται, ἐὰν μή τι καὶ τῶν τοιούτων φθέγξηται ῥημάτων. Εὐλαβήσομαι δ' αὐτὸ ποιεῖν ὡς ἂν δύνωμαι μάλιστα. Σκέψασθε δέ, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, ὡς **μετρίως** μέλλω προσφέρεσθαι Τιμάρχῳ τουτῳί. (37-39)

And I beg you to pardon me, fellow citizens, if, compelled to speak about habits which by nature are, indeed, **unclean**, but are nevertheless his, I be led to use some expression that is as bad as Timarchus' deeds. For it would not be right for you to blame me, if now and again I use plain language in my desire to inform you; the blame should rather be his, if it is a fact that **his life has been so shameful** that a man who is describing his behavior is unable to say what he wishes without sometimes using expressions that are likewise shameful. But I will try my best to avoid doing this. See, fellow citizens, **with what moderation** I am going to deal with Timarchus here.

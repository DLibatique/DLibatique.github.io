## [*ergaleia*](https://ergaleia.github.io)

Ryan Pasco, a colleague at BU, and I have long been interested in digital tools for Classics, but we were left to our own devices as to what tools were available or how they could be applied in a classroom setting. Keeping the beginner in mind, we created *ergaleia*, an abbreviated list of digital tools for the classicist that emphasizes utility and application rather than functionality, though the list includes a broad range of functionalities. We hope that this list, along with the accompanying blog, will help those interested in digital tools gain a sense of whatâ€™s available and how to apply this knowledge to teaching and research.

## [Ovid Bot](https://twitter.com/ovid_bot)

I created a Twitter bot designed to tweet out a random line of Ovid's poetry every six hours. The project data came from the [Tesserae Project](http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/), and I used Python to code the bot.

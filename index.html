<p align="center">Hi! I'm Daniel Libatique.<br>And welcome to my website!</p>

<img align="left" src="../images/headshot.jpg" style="float" width="50%">

<p>As of 2018-2019, I'm a lecturer in the Classics department at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. I earned my Ph.D. at Boston University in 2018 with a dissertation entitled <em>Tereus, Procne, and Philomela: Speech, Silence, and the Voice of Gender</em>. Prior to that, I completed my M.A. in Humanities and Social Thought at NYU in 2012 and my B.A. in Classics and Theatre at Holy Cross in 2010. I'm originally from Jersey City, NJ.</p>

<p>As a Classicist, my research generally focuses on speech, silence, and the hierarchies of power that those concepts create. My main interests include Sophocles and Greek tragedy; Ovid and Augustan poetry; performance and reception theory; narratology; gender politics; and Digital Humanities. I have an article published in <em>Classical World</em> (109.1, 2015) on Medea in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> and a note forthcoming in <em>Classical Quarterly</em> (2019) on Sophocles’ <em>Tereus</em> frr. 588 and 583. I've also presented papers at conferences from the graduate to faculty and regional levels on the meter of the <em>Pervigilium Veneris</em>; Salmacis, Tereus, Philomela, Procne, and Medea in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>; Tecmessa and speech and silence in Sophocles’ <em>Ajax</em>; the Proclamation Speech in Sophocles’ <em>Oedipus Tyrannos</em>; Cremutius Cordus in Tacitus’ <em>Annals</em>; and Ovid’s appropriation of Euripides’ Iphigenia myth in <em>Tristia</em> 4.4. At BU, I acted as instructor of record for Beginning Latin 1 (Fall 2015) and Homeric Greek (Spring 2018) and T.F. for Greek History (Fall 2013), World of Rome (Spring and Fall 2014, Spring 2016), and Warfare in Antiquity (Spring 2015).</p>

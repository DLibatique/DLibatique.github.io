# Ovid in the #MeToo Era

## 1. Tarana Burke (founder of #MeToo) on Asia Argento:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ve said repeatedly that the  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/metooMVMT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#metooMVMT</a> is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward. It will continue to be jarring when we hear the names of some of our faves connected to sexual violence unless we shift from talking about individuals [+]</p>&mdash; Tarana (@TaranaBurke) <a href="https://twitter.com/TaranaBurke/status/1031498206260150272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2018</a></blockquote>

## 2. Prof. Katharina Volk (Columbia University) on Ovid:

One possibility is to view Ovid as a proto-feminist. He’s trying to give women a voice. The other way to think about it is that he’s an extreme sexist.

## 3. Three questions for analyzing Ovid’s violent narratives:

A) **Who has** the power? __***-or-***__ **Who is deprived** of power?
B) **How** do they gain that power? __***-or-***__ **How** are they deprived of power?
C) **Who grants** them power? __***-or-***__ **Who deprives** them of power?

### 1. Ovid describes the *Fasti*: *Tristia* 2.249-252.

*sex ego Fastorum scripsi totidemque libellos,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cumque suo finem mense volumen habet,  
idque tuo nuper scriptum sub nomine, Caesar,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et tibi sacratum sors mea rupit opus.*  

I wrote six of the Fasti and as many books, and each scroll has a limit with its own month, and Caesar, it was written just now under your name, and my fate interrupted my work which was dedicated to you.

### 2. The 13 uses of *adnuo* throughout the *Fasti* (in order):

**A)** 1.15-16, Ovid commands Germanicus to assent to his poem:  
***adnue*** *conanti per laudes ire tuorum  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deque meo pavidos excute corde metus.*  
**Approve** of my attempt to go through the praiseworthy deeds of your family, and shake the trembling fears from my heart.

**B)** 2.489-90, Jupiter assents to Mars to deify Romulus:
*Iuppiter* ***adnuerat:*** *nutu tremefactus uterque  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;est polus, et caeli pondera novit Atlas.*  
Jupiter **agreed**: each pole trembled at his nod, and Atlas knew the weight of the sky.

**C)** 2.597-8, the nymphs assent to Jupiter to stop Juturna when she tries to run away:
dixerat; adnuerant nymphae Tiberinides omnes
	quaeque colunt thalamos, Ilia diva, tuos.
[Jupiter] spoke; all the nymphs of the Tiber agreed and those who cultivate your bedchambers, divine Ilia.

D) 2.699-700, Sextus Tarquinius “assents” to fight with the men of Gabii before stabbing them in the back:
flent quoque, et ut secum tueatur bella precantur.
	callidus ignaris adnuit ille viris,
[The Gabians] also weep, and they beg him to keep up the war with them. The crafty Sextus agrees to the ignorant men.

E) 3.337-8, Jupiter conditionally assents to spare Numa and the Romans from his thunderbolts:
adnuit oranti, sed verum ambage remota
	abdidit et dubio terruit ore virum,
He agreed to the one praying, but he hid the truth with deep circumlocution and terrified the man with a doubtful aspect.

F) 4.219-21, Erato confirms to the poet that Cybele wears a turreted crown because she granted towers to the first cities:
'at cur turrifera caput est onerata corona?
	an primis turres urbibus illa dedit?’
adnuit…
‘But why does she wear a crown that bears towers on her head? Because she gave towers to the first cities?’ [Erato] agreed.

G) 4.887-8, 891, the Rutulians agree to give Mezentius wine in return for his help in the war against Aeneas:
‘qui petis auxilium, non grandia divide mecum
	praemia, de lacubus proxima musta tuis. …’
adnuerant Rutuli…
‘You who seek help, divide with me a not-great prize, the freshest wine from your vats.’ … The Rutulians agreed.

H) 5.327-9, Flora assents to let the flowers and crops bloom again after a period of neglect:
convenere patres, et, si bene floreat annus,
	numinibus nostris annua festa vovent.
adnuimus voto.
The Senators came together, and they vowed annual festivals to our divinity if the year should produce a good harvest. We assented to their vow.

I) 5.357-60, Flora confirms that she dresses in colors (vs. white for Ceres) because flowers are multicolored:
an quia maturis albescit messis aristis,
	et color et species floribus omnis inest?
adnuit, et motis flores cecidere capillis,
	accidere in mensas ut rosa missa solet.
Because the harvest when grain is ripe is white, but every color and appearance is in flowers? She agreed, and flowers fell from her hair as she nods, like a rose usually falls when sent onto a table.

J) 5.530-1, Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury agree to make Hyrieus a father without making him a husband:
	‘nec coniunx et pater esse volo.’
adnuerant omnes.
‘I want to be not a husband and a father.’ They all assented.

K) 6.383-4, Vesta obeys Jupiter and ensures that bread is baked from what grain remains:
iusserat, et fratris virgo Saturnia iussis
	adnuit.
[Jupiter] ordered, and the virgin daughter of Saturn agreed to her brother’s orders.

L) 6.543, 549, Ino agrees to become the divine Leucothea at the prophecy of the priestess of Carmentis:
‘numen eris pelagi: natum quoque pontus habebit. …’
adnuerat, promissa fides,
‘You will be a divinity of the sea, and the ocean also will possess your son.’ … [Ino] agreed, her faith was pledged.

M) 6.812, Hercules agrees to Clio’s interpretation of the origins of the Temple of Hercules Musarum:
adnuit Alcides increpuitque lyram.
Alcides agreed and he made the lyre sound.

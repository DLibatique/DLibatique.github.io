## <a name="passages">Passages</a>

### 1. Ovid describes the *Fasti*: *Tristia* 2.249-252.

*sex ego Fastorum scripsi totidemque libellos,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cumque suo finem mense volumen habet,  
idque tuo nuper scriptum sub nomine, Caesar,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et tibi sacratum sors mea rupit opus.*  

I wrote six of the Fasti and as many books, and each scroll has a limit with its own month, and Caesar, it was written just now under your name, and my fate interrupted my work which was dedicated to you.

### 2. The 13 uses of *adnuo* throughout the *Fasti* (in order):

**A)** 1.15-16, Ovid commands Germanicus to assent to his poem:  
***adnue*** *conanti per laudes ire tuorum  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deque meo pavidos excute corde metus.*  
**Approve** of my attempt to go through the praiseworthy deeds of your family, and shake the trembling fears from my heart.

**B)** 2.489-90, Jupiter assents to Mars to deify Romulus:  
*Iuppiter* ***adnuerat:*** *nutu tremefactus uterque  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;est polus, et caeli pondera novit Atlas.*  
Jupiter **agreed**: each pole trembled at his nod, and Atlas knew the weight of the sky.

**C)** 2.597-8, the nymphs assent to Jupiter to stop Juturna when she tries to run away:  
*dixerat;* ***adnuerant*** *nymphae Tiberinides omnes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaeque colunt thalamos, Ilia diva, tuos.*  
[Jupiter] spoke; all the nymphs of the Tiber **agreed** and those who cultivate your bedchambers, divine Ilia.

**D)** 2.699-700, Sextus Tarquinius “assents” to fight with the men of Gabii before stabbing them in the back:  
*flent quoque, et ut secum tueatur bella precantur.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callidus ignaris* ***adnuit*** *ille viris.*  
[The Gabians] also weep, and they beg him to keep up the war with them. The crafty Sextus **agrees** to the ignorant men.

**E)** 3.337-8, Jupiter conditionally assents to spare Numa and the Romans from his thunderbolts:  
***adnuit*** *oranti, sed verum ambage remota  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abdidit et dubio terruit ore virum.*  
He **agreed** to the one praying, but he hid the truth with deep circumlocution and terrified the man with a doubtful aspect.

**F)** 4.219-21, Erato confirms to the poet that Cybele wears a turreted crown because she granted towers to the first cities:  
*'at cur turrifera caput est onerata corona?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an primis turres urbibus illa dedit?’*  
***adnuit***…  
‘But why does she wear a crown that bears towers on her head? Because she gave towers to the first cities?’ [Erato] **agreed**.

**G)** 4.887-8, 891, the Rutulians agree to give Mezentius wine in return for his help in the war against Aeneas:  
*‘qui petis auxilium, non grandia divide mecum  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praemia, de lacubus proxima musta tuis. …’*  
***adnuerant*** *Rutuli…*  
‘You who seek help, divide with me a not-great prize, the freshest wine from your vats.’ … The Rutulians **agreed**.

**H)** 5.327-9, Flora assents to let the flowers and crops bloom again after a period of neglect:  
*convenere patres, et, si bene floreat annus,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numinibus nostris annua festa vovent.*  
***adnuimus*** *voto.*  
The Senators came together, and they vowed annual festivals to our divinity if the year should produce a good harvest. We **assented** to their vow.

**I)** 5.357-60, Flora confirms that she dresses in colors (vs. white for Ceres) because flowers are multicolored:  
*an quia maturis albescit messis aristis,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et color et species floribus omnis inest?*  
***adnuit,*** *et motis flores cecidere capillis,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accidere in mensas ut rosa missa solet.*  
Because the harvest when grain is ripe is white, but every color and appearance is in flowers? She **agreed**, and flowers fell from her hair as she nods, like a rose usually falls when sent onto a table.

**J)** 5.530-1, Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury agree to make Hyrieus a father without making him a husband:  
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘nec coniunx et pater esse volo.’*  
***adnuerant*** *omnes.*  
‘I want to be not a husband and a father.’ They all **assented**.

**K)** 6.383-4, Vesta obeys Jupiter and ensures that bread is baked from what grain remains:  
*iusserat, et fratris virgo Saturnia iussis*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***adnuit.***  
[Jupiter] ordered, and the virgin daughter of Saturn **agreed** to her brother’s orders.

**L)** 6.543, 549, Ino agrees to become the divine Leucothea at the prophecy of the priestess of Carmentis:  
*‘numen eris pelagi: natum quoque pontus habebit. …’*  
***adnuerat,*** *promissa fides.*  
‘You will be a divinity of the sea, and the ocean also will possess your son.’ … [Ino] **agreed**, her faith was pledged.

**M)** 6.812, Hercules agrees to Clio’s interpretation of the origins of the Temple of Hercules Musarum:  
***adnuit*** *Alcides increpuitque lyram.*  
Alcides **agreed** and he made the lyre sound.

### 3. Augustus encouraged prominent Romans to beautify the city with building projects: Suetonius *Aug.* 29.4-5:

*sed et ceteros principes uiros saepe hortatus est, ut pro facultate quisque monimentis uel nouis uel refectis et excultis urbem adornarent. [5] multaque a multis tunc extructa sunt, sicut a Marcio Philippo aedes Herculis Musarum…*

But also, he often encouraged other prominent men each to adorn the city either with new monuments or restored and cultivated ones, as befit each’s ability. Many things were built by many people at that time, like the Temple of Hercules Musarum [built] by Marcius Philippus…

### 4. Jupiter addresses the nymphs: *F.* 2.591-596

*'invidet ipsa sibi vitatque* ***quod expedit illi***  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*vestra soror,* ***summo iungere membra deo.***  
*consulite ambobus: nam quae mea magna voluptas,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***utilitas*** *vestrae* ***magna*** *sororis erit.  
vos illi in prima* ***fugienti obsistite*** *ripa,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ne sua fluminea corpora mergat aqua.’  
dixerat;* ***adnuerant*** *nymphae Tiberinides omnes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaeque colunt thalamos, Ilia diva, tuos.*  

“She begrudges herself and avoids **that which is advantageous to her, to have sex with the highest god.** Have regard for both of us: for that which is my great desire will be **a source of great usefulness** for your sister. You all, **stop her if she flees** at the top of the riverbank, so that she doesn’t merge with the river’s water.” He spoke; all the nymphs of the Tiber **agreed** and those who cultivate your bedchambers, divine Ilia.

### 5. Lara warns Juturna and Juno about Jupiter’s intentions: *F.* 2.599-606

*forte fuit nais Lara nomine;* ***prima*** *sed illi*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***dicta bis*** *antiquum* ***syllaba*** *nomen erat,  
ex vitio positum. saepe illi dixerat Almo  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'nata,* ***tene linguam***'*: nec tamen illa tenet.  
quae simul ac tetigit Iuturnae stagna sororis,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***'effuge' ait 'ripas'***, *dicta refertque Iovis.  
illa etiam Iunonem adiit, miserataque nuptas  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'naida Iuturnam vir tuus' inquit* ***'amat.'***  

By chance, there was a nymph named Lara, but her old name used to be **the first syllable spoken twice**, placed upon her because of her fault. Often the river god Almo had said to her, “Daughter, **hold your tongue**,” but nevertheless she does not. As soon as she reached the pool of her sister Juturna, she says, “**Flee the riverbanks**,” and she relates Jove’s words. She even went to Juno, and taking pity on married women, she says, “Your husband **‘loves’** the nymph Juturna.”

### 6. Jupiter punishes Lara; Mercury rapes her: *F.* 2.607-616.

*Iuppiter intumuit,* ***quaque est non usa modeste  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eripit huic linguam,*** *Mercuriumque vocat:  
'duc hanc ad manes:* ***locus ille silentibus aptus.***  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*nympha, sed infernae nympha paludis erit.’  
iussa Iovis fiunt. accepit lucus euntes:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dicitur illa duci tum placuisse deo.*  
***vim parat hic, voltu pro verbis illa precatur,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et frustra muto nititur ore loqui,***  
*fitque gravis geminosque parit, qui compita servant  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et vigilant nostra semper in urbe Lares.*  

Jupiter was enraged, and **he ripped out her tongue, which she did not use in a modest fashion.** He calls Mercury: “Lead her to the Shades; that place is fit for the silent. She is a nymph, but she will be a nymph of the infernal marsh.” The orders of Jove came to be. A grove accepted them as they went; she is said to have pleased the god that led her at that time. **He prepared to violate her; she prayed with her face instead of words, and in vain she tried to speak with her mute mouth.** She became pregnant and gave birth to twins, who guard the crossroads and keep eternal watch in our city — the Lares.

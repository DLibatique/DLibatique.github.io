Hi! My name is Daniel Libatique. As of 2019-2020, I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Classics department at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. I earned my Ph.D. at Boston University in 2018 with a dissertation entitled *Tereus, Procne, and Philomela: Speech, Silence, and the Voice of Gender*. Prior to that, I completed my M.A. in Humanities and Social Thought at NYU in 2012 and my B.A. in Classics and Theatre at Holy Cross in 2010. I'm originally from Jersey City, NJ.

As a Classicist, my research generally focuses on speech, silence, and the hierarchies of power that those concepts create. My main interests include Ovid and Augustan poetry, gender and sexuality, narratology, Sophocles and Greek drama, performance and reception theory, and Digital Humanities. I have an article published in *Classical World* (109.1, 2015) on Medea in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* and a note in *Classical Quarterly* (68.2, 2018) on Sophocles’ *Tereus* frr. 588 and 583. I have been invited to give talks at colleges in the Northeast including BU, Wellesley, and Holy Cross on the theme of Ovid in the #MeToo era, and I've also presented papers at conferences from the graduate to faculty and regional levels on the meter of the *Pervigilium Veneris*; Salmacis, Tereus, Philomela, Procne, and Medea in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses*; Tecmessa and speech and silence in Sophocles’ *Ajax*; the Proclamation Speech in Sophocles’ *Oedipus Tyrannus*; Cremutius Cordus in Tacitus’ *Annals*; and Ovid’s appropriation of Euripides’ Iphigenia myth in *Tristia* 4.4.

At Holy Cross, I have taught courses on introductory Latin (Fall 2018 to Spring 2020), Roman literature and society (Fall 2018, Fall 2019), and gender and sexuality in the ancient world (Spring 2019). At BU, I acted as instructor of record for Beginning Latin 1 (Fall 2015) and Homeric Greek (Spring 2018) and T.F. for Greek History (Fall 2013), World of Rome (Spring and Fall 2014, Spring 2016), and Warfare in Antiquity (Spring 2015).

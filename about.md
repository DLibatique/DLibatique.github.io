Hi! I'm Daniel Libatique. Welcome to my website.

<img align="left" src="../images/headshot.jpg" style="float" style="padding: 0px 20px 0px 0px" width="50%">

As of 2019-2020, I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Classics department at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA. I completed my Ph.D. at Boston University in 2018 with a dissertation entitled *Tereus, Procne, and Philomela: Speech, Silence, and the Voice of Gender*. Prior to that, I completed my M.A. in Humanities and Social Thought at NYU and my B.A. in Classics and Theatre at Holy Cross.

As a Classicist, my research focuses on speech, silence, and the hierarchies of power that those concepts create. My main interests include Ovid and Augustan poetry; Sophocles and Greek drama; performance and reception theory; narratology; gender politics; and Digital Humanities. I have an article published in *Classical World* (109.1, 2015) on Medea in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* and a note published in *Classical Quarterly* (2019) on Sophocles’ *Tereus* frr. 588 and 583. I've also presented papers at conferences from the graduate to faculty and regional levels on the meter of the *Pervigilium Veneris*; Salmacis, Tereus, Philomela, Procne, and Medea in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses*; Tecmessa and speech and silence in Sophocles’ *Ajax*; the Proclamation Speech in Sophocles’ *Oedipus Tyrannos*; Cremutius Cordus in Tacitus’ *Annals*; and Ovid’s appropriation of Euripides’ Iphigenia myth in *Tristia* 4.4. At Holy Cross, I've taught courses on introductory Latin, Roman literature and society, and gender and sexuality in the ancient world. At BU, I acted as instructor of record for Beginning Latin 1 (Fall 2015) and Homeric Greek (Spring 2018) and T.F. for Greek History (Fall 2013), World of Rome (Spring and Fall 2014, Spring 2016), and Warfare in Antiquity (Spring 2015).
